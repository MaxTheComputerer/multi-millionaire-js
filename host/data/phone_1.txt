"I'm not sure. It could be ANS1 or ANS2 but I can't help any more than that."
"I don't know for certain but it might be ANS1. About 50% sure."
"I've only heard of ANS1 and ANS2 so I'd guess one of those."
"I can't decide between ANS1 and ANS2."
"Either ANS1 or ANS2. Definitely not the others. That's all I know I'm afraid."
"That's tricky. I'm about 50% confident it's ANS2."
"I think ANS1 and ANS2 sound more right than the other two. So maybe it's one of those?"
"I would guess ANS1. Although ANS2 sounds quite plausible too."
"Maybe ANS1? I'm 50% sure the answer's ANS1."
"50:50 as to whether I'd go ANS1 or ANS2."
